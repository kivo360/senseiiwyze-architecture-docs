EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I.
During  pandemic,  U.S.  after-tax  corporate  profits
climbed to 11.8 % of GDP—the richest share since
the  1950s.  CEOs  now  want  those  margins  every
year—without  a  public-relations  fiasco.    Since  the
pandemic their playbook has been to automate both
cognitive and manual tasks with digital infrastructure
-  AI,  Cloud  Computing  and  robots,  laying  the
pathway  to  supercharged  profit  margins  until  2024
when inflation increased cost and now tariffs. They
have  deployed  4.28  million  industrial  robots
already operating in factories in 2023 — a 10 % YoY
rise as well as 72% are using generative AI in at least
1  function.  McKinsey  and  Deloitte  report  human
adoption
the  choke-point  as  only  37%  of
companies  have  invested  in  change  management
and new-skill incentives, stalling AI adoption curves.
AI is a cultural shift that requires investment in tech
training, coaching and a culture audit to usher in the
transformation and profitability CEOs desire.

is

Our 5-year goal is to expose 10 million economically disadvantaged individuals to tech skill coaching to
eliminate  the  human  adoption  issue  that  has  slowed  AI  adoption.  We  plan  to  grow  revenue  to  $
275,000,000  million  dollars  by  2029.    Our  ultimate  goal  is  to  generate  $1  billion  in  revenue  annually,
exiting business via M&A or IPO by 2030. To achieve this goal we are returning to our roots as a national
organization following BEAD deployment which begins October 1, 2025.

Automation Workz has grown in revenue 335% since 2020. In 2025, we began laying the foundation for
our an atmospheric growth.

WHY  NOW?  Automation  Workz  was  built  on the  assertion  that technology  transformation  is  built  on
changing  the  culture  of  both  corporations  and  front-liners  to  achieve  massive  profitability.  Front-liners

addicted  to  video  games  and  consumer  technology  are  capable  of  becoming  skilled  technicians  to
execute transformation, especially since the Federal government is investing $42.5 billion for the BEAD
(Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment) initiative will train 200,000 new workers to lay fiber optics
in internet deserts accelerating AI, Robots and cloud computing.

BEAD  funding  has  accelerated  the

BEAD funding and AI Adoption is a
perfect storm for Automation Workz
to  scale  its  tech  skill  coaching
platform  across  the  entire  United
States  of  America  and  generate
massive  impact  while  generating
substantial  profits  as  states  will  be
employing  network  and  broadband
technicians  to  lay  fiber-optic  cable.
Thirteen states, including Michigan, will receive over $1 billion in BEAD Funding, laying the foundation
for our expansion.

HISTORY

II.
On the DDOT bus, in 2017, a person asked me for a paper bus schedule. I told them I use Google maps
to navigate my bus ride. As we were discussing the issue, the Grand River bus, which is normally rowdy
with 80 people, got so quiet, I could hear a pin drop.

I stood up and asked, “Does anyone else need this
lesson?” Everyone on the bus rose their hand, like
they were in a classroom. I ran to the front of the bus
and gave a Google maps lesson.

When I was stepping off the bus, the driver states, “I
have never seen such a thing!” I had not, either. I
realized  many  Detroiters  owned smartphones,  even
in the midst of the proverbial digital divide, meaning
they  desired  to  learn  about  technology.  The  rowdy
bus was eager to learn.

I immediately got off the bus and over several months created a pilot, Automation Workz, to assist front-
liners prepare for tech certification in network engineering, cybersecurity ops, and Internet of Things. We
graduated  our  first  4  learners,  May  2019.  We  discovered  the  financial  struggles  of  life  caused
economically disadvantaged young people to drop out of training.

Automation  Workz  officially  began  March  18,  2019  when  we  received  our  State  of  Michigan  license.
Operation began in 2020 as an Income Share Agreement school, serving those with Bachelor’s degree
in liberal arts who desired to move into tech careers. These learners signed an agreement to pay back
tuition over 3 years after they received a higher-paying career. We financed training with a $10 million
dollar line of credit from Blair, Inc.

AUTOMATION WORKZ      440 Burroughs. Ste. 173     Detroit, MI 48202    313-444-4885         ida@autoworkz.org                   Page | 4

Automation  Workz  had
in  California,  Florida,
learners
Georgia,  Indiana,  Maryland,  Michigan,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,
Texas and Wisconsin.

Federal  government  ruled  ISA  investors  like  Blair  did  not
provide  Truth-In-Lending  disclosures  to  individual  learners
and thus made the financing arrangement nonprofitable. We
had been adding workforce development funding since 2020
and accelerated it in 2021 as it had no interest payments, no
receivable  commitments  and  payment  is  received  within  60
days. Blair $10 million Line of Credit ended in 2022.

In 2021, Automation Workz was ranked as one of the nation’s
top  10  Cybersecurity  Bootcamps  by  Career  Karma  and
named  one  of  the  top  10  Best  Cybersecurity  Bootcamps  2022  and  2023  by  Intelligent.com  having
increased front-liner training completion rates from 7.93% to 75% and average graduate annual salaries
from $31,200 to $67,250. The Automation Workz highest graduate has achieved $166,000, after 3 years
of employment with 30% of graduates earning over $70,000.

2. Automation Workz creates a profile based on their diagnostic assessment.
3. The profile is analyzed by AI and predictive data is transmitted into an institutional dashboard.
4. If  institution  decides to  train front-liners,  Automation  Workz  offers  programs  in  AI  &  Data  Analytics,
cybersecurity, Internet of Things – Tech Support and network engineering (broadband). Programs are
part-time with 3 hours of group coaching and AI-graded simulation labs over a 12-48 week time period,
depending upon the specialty.

AI provides this analysis that includes Program Readiness Dashboard of what program a learner is ready
to complete, a synopsis on how close a learner is to other rigorous programs, what is necessary to coach
them to be ready for other specialties and what other soft/ culturally adaptive skills do they possess.

DUAL MARKETING STRATEGY

IV.
Automation Workz utilizes a dual-sided marketing strategy within a two-sided platform model, similar to
Salesforce. We train economically disadvantaged end-users (front-liners) into middle-skilled roles while
simultaneously,  engaging  institutional  customers  who  pay  our  fees,  how  to  change  their  culture  to
accelerate adoption of emerging tech, like AI. This B2B2C dual-sided marketing strategy ensures that
front-liners  demand  for  training/promotion  and  institutional  demand  grows  symbiotically—each  driving
value to the other thus maximizing our market traction and systemic impact.

Automation Workz caters to the industrious employees - front-liners who have visions for a better life
and the executives managing them who desires to secure promotion as well.

VI.      CUSTOMER ANALYSIS & PERSONAS
Automation Workz derives its revenue from 2 institutional customers – workforce development agencies
and corporations who pay fees on behalf of front-liners. We focus on 4 executive personas.

HR Holly

Our  journey  began  with  HR,  as  our  first
customers  were  HR  Managers  at  Dr.
Bronner’s  Magic  Soap,  GTB  (Ford  Motor
Company’s  marketing  agency  for  80  years),
and the Edsel & Eleanor Ford House.
The  CEO  of  Automation  Workz  was  a  Final
Four  competitor  out  of  300  entries  in  the
SHRM  Better  Workplaces  Challenge  Cup
2022.  Human  Resources  leaders  play  a
pivotal  role  in  shaping  company  culture,  as
they  are  responsible  for  implementing  and
enforcing  corporate  policies.  Workforce
development, employee equity, and company
culture  are  intrinsically  linked.  Yet,  too  often,

We recognized that true cultural transformation includes a commitment to equity in training, promotions,
and  career  advancement.  By  working  directly  with  HR  leaders,  we  ensured  that  their  insights  were
integrated into workforce development strategies, fostering an inclusive culture where employee equity
is  prioritized.  This  collaboration  eliminates  resistance  and  aligns  workforce  growth  with  a  fair  and
empowering company culture.

Workforce  Wanda  –  We  discovered  that  this
executive  always  has  access  to  funding  for  career
training,  but  the  workforce  development  system
often  falls  short  in  providing  the  best  training
providers.  With  support  from  Cisco  Systems,  we
have  introduced rigorous  tech  certifications  in  AI  &
Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, Network Engineering,
and the Internet of Things (IoT), making us the first
new  school  in  20  years  to  earn  the  Above  and
Beyond  award  globally.  Automation  Workz  has
delivered  6  of  the  top  10  Michigan  workforce
development  salaries  upon  graduation.  These
individuals  will  be  key  in  deploying  BEAD  funding,
ensuring  a  strong  and  skilled  workforce  for  the
future.

The  pandemic,  along  with  tariffs,  has  placed  significant  focus  on  the  supply  chain  and  its  impact  on
corporate  profitability.  Despite  this,  Procurement  has  been  actively  shaping  internal  corporate  culture,
collaborating  with  colleagues  to  address  supplier  challenges.  Yet,  their  efforts  rarely  receive  the
recognition they deserve. Furthermore, Procurement also influences external culture, impacting suppliers
who employ millions. While their contribution to corporate culture is significant, it often goes unnoticed.
We now have the opportunity to elevate Procurement officers as corporate heroes by fostering a positive
culture in their interactions with both colleagues and suppliers, while also securing suppliers—at all three
tiers—as loyal, referral customers.

HR Holly manages small and mid-sized HR departments with employee counts from 50-999. According
to NAICS Association, there are 295,651 businesses in the US with 50-999 employees, approximately
276,433 have 50-500 employees and are considered by Federal government as a small business.) SBA
reports  from  2021  through  the first  quarter  of  2023,  the  U.S.  economy  added  a  net  7.2  million  small

her corporation grows quickly and continually grows.

HR Holly is stressed to fill the shortage of skilled technicians needed to
grow her company. She is upskilling current employees while looking for
new employees who are AI literate. HR Holly needs assistance with:

Training Pre-assessment – Select front-liners with digital skills or those
interested in completing tech training.

Recruitment  Pre-assessment  –  Select  front-liners  for  specific  jobs
according to personality.

Performance  Review  –  Goal  setting  and  planning  for  better  job

performance, reduce turnover and absenteeism.

Workforce Wanda is responsible for Department of Labor Work Innovation Opportunity Act funding,
utilized from ages 14-retirement. This funding was established to reskill individuals earning less than
$50,000 to improve their skills in high-demand occupations.

Automation Workz has been serving 6 counties and plan to expand across the US. With the  $42.5 Billion
BEAD – Broadband, Equity Access and Deployment initiative, every state is required to file a Workforce
Development Plan alongside its fiber build-out maps. Those plans must document credential standards,
diversity  metrics,  and  post-training  wage  outcomes—effectively  turning  cultural  adoption  into  a
compliance item.

Procurement Pete can be an excellent referral source to secure contracts from corporations within the
supply chain. Procurement Pete distributes billions of dollars of contracts annually. He holds strategic
and cultural control over a company’s suppliers through the contract and purchase order (PO) process.
Once a department requests goods or services, Procurement Pete negotiates the contract and issues
the PO—making the terms binding for both the supplier and internal teams. No payment or fulfillment
happens without Procurement Pete’s authorization, giving him control over who the company buys from,
at what cost, and under what terms. This central role ensures supplier performance, enforces compliance,
and aligns purchases with company strategy.

Foundations allocate $105.21 billion annually to community initiatives aimed at increasing the income of
economically disadvantaged residents, helping lift them out of poverty. Foundation Francine is funding
projects that prepare young people for post-secondary education, workforce development training, and
college/university enrollment, with the goal of improving their income through skill acquisition. However,
during the tech revolution, she is recognizing that the return on investment (ROI) from these efforts has
been lower than expected, as many individuals are losing jobs due to automation. While tech jobs tend

SALES FROM THE STAGE
Automation  Workz  is  led  by  a  visionary  CEO  who  consistently  drives  sales  from  the  stage  as  she
embodies the company’s mission. A former resident of Flint’s public housing projects, she defied the
odds by becoming a COBOL programmer, earning a degree in economics, mastering data analytics,
and emerging as a passionate, high-impact public speaker. Her authentic story and expertise resonate
deeply with both aspiring learners and corporate leaders.

Rather than rely solely on social media and advertising to position Automation Workz for growth, we
seek to utilize its CEO’s gift to drive sales from the stage at
conferences where its 4 customer personas network and at
gatherings  where  end-users  occupy.  Our  CEO  began  the
process  in  2022  as  an  appointee  to  the  Detroit  Regional
Chamber  of  Commerce Board  and  the  CEO  Talent  Council
led  by  Peter  Quigley,  CEO  of  Kelly  Services.  Our  CEO
presented a 10-minute Mackinac Moment in 2022 in front of
1700 executive leaders. It was televised on Detroit Public TV.

Many in-person keynote speaking engagements are tied to sponsorships and not just being a Subject

has been currently constrained by the high cost of conference sponsorships and exhibit booths required
to  secure  speaking  opportunities  in  front  of  executive  decision-makers.  With  strategic  investment  to
amplify  her  presence  on  those  influential  stages,  Automation  Workz  is  primed  to  scale  its  impact  by
connecting with more institutional buyers.

API INTEGRATIONS INTO PAYROLL & HRIS SYSTEMS
Automation Workz will offer SenseiiWyze plug-ins for payroll, Human Resources Information Systems
(HRIS) and performance management system. A well-architected plug-in elevates SenseiiWyze from a
bolt-on “diagnostic tool” to live skill data weaved right into the HR system’s “brain,” so everything stays
up to date and managers never need to switch apps.

SenseiiWyze  integration  can  provide  two-way,  real-time  updates.  When  someone  finishes  an
assessment, the plug-in instantly alerts the HR system. When the HR system logs a new hire, promotion,
or  transfer,  it  pings  SenseiiWyze  to  refresh  that  person’s  profile.  Both  systems  stay  in  sync,  so
employees see their latest badges right on their self-service pages, encouraging co-workers to take the
skill test too. Managers can open a “future leaders” view and filter for people with an 80 % or higher
tech-readiness  score—without  leaving  the  HR  system.  HR  teams  can  export  promotion  lists  that
highlight  skill  gaps,  ready  for  leadership  meetings.  Performance-management  systems  automatically
pull  in  badge  data,  so  annual  reviews  and  goal-setting  conversations  are  based  on  real,  up-to-date
skills—not guesswork. Integration reduces executive friction and locks in the account.
SenseiiWyze  will  be  integrated  into  payroll,  Human  Resources  Information  Systems  (HRIS)  and
performance management software at all levels of corporations. Here are top software companies.

FRONT-LINER TECH READINESS INDEX
Automation Workz will publish an annual “Front-Liner Tech Readiness Index” ranking metro areas
and industries by aggregated SenseiiWyze scores. PR backlinks that attract new users, plus benchmark
tables that make execs ask, “Where do we sit? It also forces workforce development agencies to see
where they stand  in tech readiness preparation.

          CONSUMER FRONT-LINER MARKETING POSITIONING

VIII.
We  are marketing  Automation  Workz  under  the  theme  REVIVING THE AMERICAN  DREAM to front-
liners.

The American Dream is a joyful wedding, homeownership, dependable transportation, the means to give
their children a comfortable life and college education, and a worry-free retirement. Corporate America
originally  forged  the  concept  of  the  American  Dream—  Now,  even  amid  tariff-driven  economic
headwinds, it must reclaim and refresh that vision for the nation.  The American Dream sold goods,
kept workers motivated, justified free-enterprise capitalism, and helped the United States compete with
rival ideologies. Front-liners have begun to doubt they will ever reach the Dream’s classic milestones.
Investopedia calculates that fulfilling this checklist now demands roughly $3.4 million in lifetime wealth,
or an annual income of about $113,520.

AUTOMATION WORKZ      440 Burroughs. Ste. 173     Detroit, MI 48202    313-444-4885         ida@autoworkz.org                   Page | 20

There are only 4 careers where people can earn $113,520 annually to achieve the American Dream.

The  top  3  career  clusters  (Doctor,  Lawyer,  Corporate  Executive)  require  6-10  years  of  college  –  a
bachelor’s  and  professional  degree.  Most  front-liners  do  not  desire  to  attend  college  that  long.
Consequently, front-liners have NO hope for their future. Even when there is an opportunity to improve
their lives, they give up and quit.  The last one (Tech Worker) requires hands-on skills and a 36-48 weeks
tech  certification  training  in  these  specialties:  IoT,  cybersecurity  ops,  AI  &  data  analytics,  network
engineering, and tech project management.  Becoming a tech worker is fully possible, even for the front-
liner.

The issue is how to get front-liners prepared for tech careers.  SenseiiWyze will lead the process.

FRONT-LINER REFERRAL SYSTEM
1.  Front-liner who complete the SenseiiWyze diagnostic will be issued a SenseiiWyze Tech Training
Ready badge to place on résumés and social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram) that illustrates
they are coachable to attend emerging tech training. Badges create social proof that recruits peers
(“Hey, where’d you get that badge?”) and give execs hard evidence of hidden talent pools.

2.  Every front-liner will qualify for an entry into our monthly SenseiiWyze Sweepstakes Cash Giveaway

AUTOMATION WORKZ      440 Burroughs. Ste. 173     Detroit, MI 48202    313-444-4885         ida@autoworkz.org                   Page | 21

when a colleague completes the SenseiiWyze diagnostic.

3.  Learners earn badges for each skill module they complete.

4.  Front-liners will be able to complete initial diagnostic without a company sponsor. When more than
20 employees at the same email domain or employer name finish the diagnostic, Automation Workz
will automatically email HR a teaser dashboard: skill gaps, engagement scores, and a 30-day trend
line. This will convert front-liner momentum into an inbound enterprise lead while the insight is fresh.

REGIONAL AND STATE SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS
Our  Learning  Success  Coach  is  our  institutional  account  executive  responsible  for  interaction  with
workforce agencies and corporations once a multi-year contract is signed.

Our  Learning  Success  Coach  provides  regional  and  state  speaking  engagements.  They  also  attend
career fairs, opportunity fairs and any events where both customer, represented by career coaches and
end-user learners are attending.

HUSTLE & TECHknow: Humanoid Experience in the ‘Hood OUTREACH
Young people are attracted to sensationalism and the mathematical/scientific foundation of IT careers is
seen as boring, thus young people avoid IT careers, limiting their career opportunities. As a part of its
Dual-marketing strategy, Automation Workz will host an full-day outreach/ PR event with humanoid robots
pitted in competitions with humans in multiple regions/ cities. Four hours will be for the general public and
4 hours for corporate executives.

Sample Event Competitions
Dance Off - Humanoid robot vs Human to perform dance routine. The audience, by polling app, will
judge who won.
The Great Downloader Showdown - Humanoid robot vs Human will convince people at an event to
download and use a Vision Board App. Whoever has the most downloads and uses, win.

Manufactured Part Assembly - Humanoid robot vs Human to assemble a manufactured part for a panel
of judges who will issue a score based on speed and accuracy.

A humanoid robot experience is sensational as many residents have never seen such a robot, potentially
jarring them and their parents to consider a high-paying IT career.  According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics,  the  median IT  salary  is  $104,420  compared  the median  wage for  all  jobs  of  $59,228,  for  a
difference of $45,192.

These Outreach events are sure to attract the media and will be packaged as a documentary and posted
on Tubi, Amazon Prime or Netflix to drive more young people to inquire into high-paying IT careers
