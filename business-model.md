## 💰 Revenue Model

### Core Value Proposition & Clarity Framework

**The Magic Formula:**
```plaintext
Employee's Dreams + Employee's Skills + Market Reality = Investment Recommendation
```

**What We Actually Do (In Plain English):**
We turn "gut feelings about employees" into "data-driven investment decisions" by combining:
- **Vision boards** (what employees want)
- **Mobile games** (what employees can do) 
- **Government job data** (what employers need)

**Our Competitive Advantage:** "While others guess who to train, you predict who will succeed."

**Core Data Sources:**
| Input Type | What It Tells You | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vision Board Colors/Images** | Personality & Motivations | Red/Orange = Leadership drive |
| **Mobile Game Performance** | Current Skill Levels | Pattern recognition = Attention to detail |
| **BLS Job Requirements** | Market Standards | Supervisor needs 7/10 leadership skills |

**Four Core Predictions:**
| Question HR Asks | Our Answer | How We Know |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **"Who will quit?"** | Flight Risk Score (0-100) | Low career aspiration + skills mismatch |
| **"Who will finish training?"** | Training Completion % | High learning scores + growth imagery |
| **"Who's worth investing in?"** | Investment ROI Score | Low flight risk + high skill potential |
| **"Who will join programs?"** | Participation Likelihood | Engagement patterns + goal alignment |
