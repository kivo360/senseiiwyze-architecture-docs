# SenseiWyze Repository Project Summary

## Project Overview and Objectives

**Purpose**: The SenseiiWyze project integrates three powerful systems to create a comprehensive workforce development and business impact measurement solution that predicts training readiness and measures ROI.

**Goals**:
- Assess candidate readiness through vision boards, cognitive games, and personality tests
- Predict optimal program matches using machine learning models
- Measure business impact and ROI of training investments through the Profitability Flow KPI Tree
- Automate intervention workflows and enrollment processes via ActiveCampaign integration
- Enable data-driven workforce development with measurable business results

**Target Outcome**: 25-35% EBITDA improvement through predictive analytics, targeted interventions, and comprehensive business impact tracking.

## Key Technical Components Analyzed

**Architecture**:
- **Unified Database Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL/Supabase schema with 29+ tables integrating prediction system with existing infrastructure
- **Data Flow Pipeline**: Vision board analysis → Cognitive scoring → Personality assessment → Readiness prediction → Program matching
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Real-time webhooks and automated workflows for seamless user experience

**Data Schema**: 
- **Core Tables**: `training_readiness_predictions`, `vision_board_analysis`, `cognitive_scores`, `personality_assessments`
- **Integration Tables**: `prediction_outcome_tracking`, `activecampaign_sync`, `training_profitability_impact`
- **KPI Tables**: `employee_kpi_scores`, `employee_outcomes`, `business_impact_metrics`

**Diagrams**: 
- Complete Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) with 240+ table relationships
- Interactive Profitability Flow KPI Tree with 6 layers: Data Sources → KPIs → Programs → Outcomes → Impacts → Financial Results
- System architecture diagrams showing integration points and data flows
